# Social Media Research – Pre‑collection Checklist

Before collecting any social media data for research, ensure you have considered the following points.

## 1. Ethical and Legal Groundwork
- [ ] **Ethics approval:** Have you obtained necessary ethical approval from your institution’s review board (IRB/REC)?
- [ ] **Platform terms of service:** Have you reviewed the platform’s terms of service, developer policies, and data‑use guidelines to ensure compliance?
- [ ] **Legal jurisdiction:** Are you aware of relevant data‑protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) that apply to the data subjects and your research location?

## 2. Data Source Assessment
- [ ] **Public vs. private:** Have you determined whether the data source is truly public, semi‑private (e.g., closed groups), or private (e.g., direct messages)?
- [ ] **Expectation of privacy:** Have you considered users’ reasonable expectation of privacy in this context?
- [ ] **Vulnerable groups:** Does the data involve minors, marginalised communities, or other vulnerable populations? If yes, have you taken extra safeguards?

## 3. Consent Strategy
- [ ] **Consent model:** Have you decided on an appropriate consent model (e.g., opt‑out, opt‑in, tiered consent) for the data source?
- [ ] **Consent information:** Have you prepared a clear, accessible explanation of the research for participants (see `public_post_consent_info.md`)?
- [ ] **Withdrawal mechanism:** Is there a straightforward way for users to opt out or request data deletion?

## 4. Privacy and Anonymisation
- [ ] **De‑identification plan:** Have you defined which identifiers (usernames, profile URLs, location data, etc.) will be removed or pseudonymised?
- [ ] **Re‑identification risk:** Have you assessed the risk that anonymised data could be re‑identified through unique attribute combinations?
- [ ] **Data storage:** Will the collected data be stored securely, with access limited to authorised researchers?
- [ ] **Retention period:** Have you set a clear retention period after which the data will be deleted?

## 5. Data Quality and Integrity
- [ ] **Authenticity checks:** Do you have a method to identify and exclude content from bots, trolls, or inauthentic accounts?
- [ ] **Context preservation:** Will you capture sufficient context (e.g., full thread, timestamps, edits) to avoid misinterpretation?
- [ ] **Bias awareness:** Are you aware of potential biases (self‑selection, platform demographics) and planning to document them?

## 6. Harm Minimisation
- [ ] **Benefit vs. harm:** Have you weighed the potential benefits of the research against possible harms to individuals or communities?
- [ ] **Sensitive topics:** If studying sensitive topics, have you considered additional measures to protect participants?
- [ ] **Transparency:** Are you prepared to be transparent about your research goals, methods, and data usage?

## 7. Documentation and Transparency
- [ ] **Research protocol:** Have you documented your data‑collection protocol, including search queries, date ranges, and inclusion/exclusion criteria?
- [ ] **Data‑processing steps:** Will you record all data‑processing steps (anonymisation, filtering, aggregation) for reproducibility?
- [ ] **Publication plan:** Do you plan to share your anonymised dataset or analysis code (where ethically and legally permissible)?
