# Ethical Framework for Social Media Research

This repository provides a practical, living toolkit for researchers at NatCen (and beyond) who use social media data in social science studies. It aims to address key ethical challenges through a clear framework, reusable templates, and collaborative discussion.

## Contents

- **[ETHICAL_FRAMEWORK.md](./ETHICAL_FRAMEWORK.md)** – Core principles and guidelines on informed consent, anonymity, data integrity, and harm minimisation.
- **[templates/](./templates/)** – Practical resources for researchers and participants:
  - [public_post_consent_info.md](./templates/public_post_consent_info.md) – A ready‑to‑use information sheet for notifying users about research using their public posts.
  - [researcher_checklist.md](./templates/researcher_checklist.md) – A pre‑collection checklist covering ethical, legal, and methodological considerations.
- **Issues (discussion topics)** – Three key ethical dilemmas are documented as GitHub Issues (see the [Issues tab](https://github.com/anikhasdreshbipo/social-media-research-ethics/issues)):
  1. **Consent for Public vs. Private Data** – What constitutes ‘informed consent’ when data is publicly posted? How does this differ for private groups or direct messages?
  2. **Ensuring User Anonymity and Data Protection** – Best practices for anonymising user data and handling re‑identification risks.
  3. **Assessing Data Quality and Authenticity** – How to ethically assess the veracity of social media posts and handle content from bots or inauthentic accounts.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Read the framework** – Start with `ETHICAL_FRAMEWORK.md` to understand the core ethical principles.
2. **Adapt the templates** – Copy and modify the consent information and checklist to fit your specific project.
3. **Join the discussion** – Comment on the existing issues or open new ones to share your experiences, questions, and suggestions.
4. **Contribute** – Fork the repository, propose improvements via pull requests, and help keep the framework up‑to‑date with evolving platforms and regulations.

## Background

This project was initiated by a researcher at NatCen interested in the ethical implications of using social media data in social science. The goal is to move beyond abstract debate and create a concrete, actionable resource that promotes ethical research practices while respecting the rights and expectations of social media users.
