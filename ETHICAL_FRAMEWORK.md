# Core Principles

## 1. Informed Consent (Reference Issue #1)
- **Public vs. Private Distinction:** Determine whether the data is truly public (e.g., tweets with public settings) or semi‑private (e.g., posts in a closed Facebook group). Different consent models may apply.
- **Informed Consent for Public Data:** Even for public data, consider whether users have a reasonable expectation that their posts could be used for research. When feasible, seek explicit consent via direct message or a public call.
- **Consent Models:** Explore tiered consent (e.g., opt‑out, opt‑in), broad platform‑level consent (e.g., via terms of service), and contextual integrity (use data only in contexts similar to the original posting).

## 2. Anonymity and Privacy (Reference Issue #2)
- **De‑identification Best Practices:** Remove or pseudonymise usernames, profile URLs, location data, and any other directly identifiable information. Consider using hashing techniques for user IDs.
- **Re‑identification Risk Assessment:** Evaluate the risk that anonymised data could be linked back to individuals through unique combinations of attributes (e.g., rare job titles, specific life events). Apply additional aggregation or perturbation if needed.
- **Data Storage and Access:** Store scraped data securely, limit access to authorised researchers, and define a clear retention period after which data should be deleted.

## 3. Data Integrity (Reference Issue #3)
- **Authenticity Checks:** Develop protocols to detect and exclude content from bots, trolls, or inauthentic accounts. Use platform‑provided indicators (e.g., verified badges) where available.
- **Context Preservation:** Capture the full context of a post (e.g., thread, replies, timestamps) to avoid misinterpretation. Note when content has been edited or deleted after collection.
- **Quality Assessment:** Acknowledge limitations of social media data (e.g., representativeness, self‑selection bias) and document these in the research outputs.

## 4. Minimising Harm
- **Beneficence and Non‑maleficence:** Strive to maximise the benefit of the research while minimising potential harm to individuals or communities. Consider the impact of publishing sensitive topics.
- **Vulnerable Populations:** Take extra care when studying groups that may be at higher risk (e.g., minors, marginalised communities, victims of trauma). Obtain additional ethical approvals if required.
- **Transparency and Accountability:** Be transparent about research goals, methods, and data usage. Provide a clear channel for participants to raise concerns or request data removal.
