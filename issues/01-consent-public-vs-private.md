# Consent for Public vs. Private Data

**Discussion topic:** What constitutes 'informed consent' when data is publicly posted? How does this differ for private groups or direct messages? Brainstorm different consent models.

## Key Questions
, When is a social media post considered "public" for research purposes?
, Does a user's expectation of privacy change depending on platform (e.g., Twitter vs. Facebook closed groups)?
, What are the ethical obligations when using data from semi‑private spaces (e.g., subreddits, closed Facebook groups)?
, Can platform terms of service substitute for individual consent?
, What consent models are feasible for large‑scale social media research (opt‑out, opt‑in, tiered consent)?

## Potential Guidelines
, **Public data:** Consider that public posts may still carry an expectation of contextual integrity. Researchers should assess whether the use aligns with the original context of posting.
, **Private/semi‑private data:** Explicit consent should be sought wherever feasible. If obtaining individual consent is impractical, consider alternative safeguards (e.g., aggregation, exclusion of sensitive content).
, **Transparency:** Always inform users about the research, even when using public data, through a clear public statement or direct message where possible.
, **Withdrawal mechanism:** Provide a straightforward way for users to opt out or request removal of their data.
