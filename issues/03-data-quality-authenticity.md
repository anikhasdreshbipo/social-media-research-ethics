# Assessing Data Quality and Authenticity

**Discussion topic:** How can we ethically assess the veracity of social media posts? What are the implications of using data from bots, trolls, or inauthentic accounts in our research?

## Key Questions
, What methods can researchers use to detect bot‑generated content, astroturfing, or coordinated inauthentic behaviour?
, How should we handle content that is suspected to be misinformation or disinformation? Does including it in a dataset lend it undeserved credibility?
, What are the ethical responsibilities when analysing hate speech, harassment, or other harmful content on social media?
, How can we preserve the context of a post (e.g., replies, timestamps, edits) to avoid misinterpretation?
, What limitations (self‑selection bias, platform‑specific demographics, algorithmic amplification) should be acknowledged when drawing conclusions from social media data?

## Potential Guidelines
, **Authenticity screening:** Use a combination of platform‑provided signals (verified badges, account creation dates, follower‑following ratios) and third‑party tools (bot‑detection APIs) to flag potentially inauthentic accounts. Document the screening criteria.
, **Contextual integrity:** Capture the full thread, timestamps, and any edits/deletions where possible. Note when content has been removed after collection.
, **Handling harmful content:** Establish a protocol for dealing with hate speech, threats, or graphic material. Consider whether such content is essential to the research question; if not, exclude it. If included, ensure appropriate safeguards for researchers and avoid amplifying harmful messages.
, **Transparency about limitations:** Explicitly discuss the limitations of social media data in research outputs. Acknowledge biases and warn against over‑generalising findings to broader populations.
, **Ethical use of misinformation datasets:** If studying misinformation, design the study to minimise the risk of spreading false claims (e.g., by not reproducing the full false content, focusing on patterns rather than individual posts).
